PacMan recreation using pygame and python. Player is moved by arrow keys and the goal is to eat all the pellets

The ghosts choose a random point on the map to Breadths First Search making them more unpredictable then in the original pacman

To play a demo to the game, you can find it here: https://replit.com/@RajPandya/PacMan#main.py

It might not fit in some resolutions, but it should be atleast somewhat playable
